This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl programming: using an uninitialized variable. The `bug.pl` file contains code that attempts to perform an arithmetic operation on an uninitialized variable, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors. The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a solution to this problem by checking if the variable is defined and handling the case where it's not.
